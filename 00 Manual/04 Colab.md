# 04 Training and Tracking with Colab

## Introduction

AlphaTracker is tested in Linux systems broadly and those systems that have GPUs. However, if you would do not have Linux-compatible system or do not have access to consumer GPUs, you can use Google Colab for the purposes of training and tracking Alphatracker!

## An Important Notice Before You Continue:

Google Colab is only useful for training and inference purposes. If you have a fully-labeled set of data using the Alphatracker annotation tool, continue on...if you have NOT labeled your data, **please complete this step first!**

Click `Runtime` and then `Change runtime type`...from the dropdown menu, select `GPU`. 

### Step 4:
